This project contains 46 subjects at two sessions each. At each sessions,
subjects acquired 6 repetitions of the ANT task (1-6). Scans are the same
by number across subjects, although they were presented in varying orders.
Task timing and anatomical scans by session are also included.

The derivatives/ directory contains AFNI-preprocessed scans as well as
anatomical scans skullstripped before defacing. The derivatives have been
slice-timing corrected already, so 0s are provided for that field.

At the top level is complete demographic information, the AFNI script for
preprocessing.

Exceptions
----------
One subject (RC4206) had an acquisition error during their second session
structural scan. Correspondingly, their structural scan from their first
session has been copied for their second session to create a valid
BIDS directory.
